Description: PyNSXv
        ======
        
        PyNSXv is a high level python based library that exposes ready to use
        work-flows and a CLI tool that can be used to control VMware NSX for
        vSphere
        
        PyNSXv can be used in two different ways, as a library by importing the
        files in the /library subdirectory into your code, or as a CLI tool by
        executing ``pynsxv``\ on the command line after installation. To install
        PyNSXv you can use PIP on your system

        Using PyNSXv as a CLI Tool
        ==========================
        
        After you installed PyNSXv, the first thing you have to do is to create
        your a ``ini`` file that contains the host names and credentials of your
        vCenter and NSX Manager.
        
        If you have multiple NSX environments, you can create multiple ``ini``
        files and reference to them using the ``-i`` command line option. By
        default PyNSXv will look for a file called ``nsx.ini`` in the path your
        are running the pynsxv command in.
        
        The ``ini`` file has the following format:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
            # [nsxraml]
            # nsxraml_file = <>
            # Uncomment the above section and add the path to the raml spec you want to use instead of the bundled version
        
            [nsxv]
            nsx_manager = <nsx_manager_IP>
            nsx_username = admin
            nsx_password = <nsx_manager_password>
        
            [vcenter]
            vcenter = <VC_IP_or_Hostname>
            vcenter_user = administrator@domain.local
            vcenter_passwd = <vc_password>
        
            [defaults]
            transport_zone = <transport_zone_name>
            datacenter_name = <vcenter datacenter name>
            edge_datastore = <datastore name to deploy edges in>
            edge_cluster = <vcenter cluster for edge gateways>
        
        After placing the ``nsx.ini`` file in you path, you can run pynsxv from
        your shell or cmd prompt. On Linux and Mac simply use ``pynsxv``
        followed by the subcommand. On Windows you will need to type
        ``pynsxv.exe`` followed by the subcommand:
        
        ::
        
            ▶ pynsxv -h
            usage: pynsxv [-h] [-i INI] [-v] [-d] {lswitch,dlr,esg,dhcp,dfw,usage} ...
        
            PyNSXv Command Line Client for NSX for vSphere
        
            positional arguments:
              {lswitch,dlr,esg,dhcp,dfw,usage}
                lswitch             Functions for logical switches
                dlr                 Functions for distributed logical routers
                esg                 Functions for edge services gateways
                dhcp                Functions for Edge DHCP
                dfw                 Functions for distributed firewall
                usage               Functions to retrieve NSX-v usage statistics
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -i INI, --ini INI     nsx configuration file
              -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
              -d, --debug           print low level debug of http transactions
        
        Here is an example output using the lswitch subcommand:
        
        ::
        
            ▶ pynsxv lswitch list
            +---------------------+----------------+
            | LS name             | LS ID          |
            |---------------------+----------------|
            | edge_ls             | virtualwire-63 |
            | dlr_ls              | virtualwire-64 |
            +---------------------+----------------+
        
        | Each subcommand has its own set of subcommands, as well as arguments.
        | You can see what is available by using ``-h`` after the first
          subcommand:
        
        ::
        
            ▶ pynsxv lswitch -h
            usage: cli.py lswitch [-h] [-t TRANSPORT_ZONE] [-n NAME] command
        
            Functions for logical switches
        
            positional arguments:
              command
                                        create: create a new logical switch
                                        read:   return the virtual wire id of a logical switch
                                        delete: delete a logical switch"
                                        list:   return a list of all logical switches
        
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -t TRANSPORT_ZONE, --transport_zone TRANSPORT_ZONE
                                    nsx transport zone
              -n NAME, --name NAME  logical switch name, needed for create, read and delete
        
        You can also use the ``-v`` switch of the main pynsxv command to switch
        to a json formated output for use with shell scripts
        
        Using PyNSXv as a Python Library
        ================================
        
        When using PyNSXv as a Python library you can either download the
        individual modules in ``/library`` of this repo and import them in your
        code, or you can install PyNSXv and import the modules from your python
        path for pip installed modules.
        
        | To use the modules you will also need to have at least the
          ``nsxramlclient`` installed (https://github.com/vmware/nsxramlclient).
        | You will also need a copy of the latest RAML API Spec of NSX for
          vSphere (https://github.com/vmware/nsxraml).
        
        | Import the module you want to use, as well as the NsxClient Class of
          the ``nsxramlclient``.
        | Then instantiate a session object of the NsxClient Class, and pass
          this session object to the function you want to use out of the module
          imported from PyNSXv. Here's an example:
        
        .. code:: ipython
        
            ▶ ipython
            Python 2.7.11 (default, Jun 17 2016, 20:01:51)

            logical_switch_list(client_session)
                This function returns all logical switches found in NSX
                :param client_session: An instance of an NsxClient Session
                :return: returns a tuple, the first item is a list of tuples with item 0 containing the LS Name as string
                         and item 1 containing the LS id as string. The second item contains a list of dictionaries containing
                         all logical switch details

        | **`Various caveats <###Various%20caveats>`__**
        
        Installing PyNSXv on Ubuntu
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        First update/upgrade using apt and install the python-openssl, libxml
        and libxslt dependencies of the ``nsxramclient`` using apt. Please also
        consult the Github page of the ``nsxramclient`` and ``pyvmomi`` in case
        you run into issues during the installation of these dependencies.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
            apt-get install python-openssl libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev zlib1g-dev python-pip -y
        
        After this you can simply install PyNSXv using pip:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            sudo pip install pynsxv
        
        Installing PyNSXv on a MAC
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Make sure to install XCODE and its Command Line utilities:
        https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            xcode-select --install
        
        If not yet present on your system, install python pip. The instructions
        on how to do so can be found here:
        https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/#install-or-upgrade-pip
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
            sudo python get-pip.py
        
        If you don't have it yet, install homebrew on your system:
        http://brew.sh
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        
        Now install some of the xml formating dependencies needed by PyNSXv and
        the underlying nsxramlclient
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            brew install libxml2
            brew install libxslt
            brew link libxml2 --force
            brew link libxslt --force
        
        Finaly we are ready to install PyNSXv using pip:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            sudo pip install pynsxv
        
        **NOTE**: OSX 10.11 El Capitan introduces problems due to an outdated
        dependency ``six``. Due to OSX's new System Integrity Protection (SIP)
        pip cannot remove the outdated version and install the needed one:
        http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/209572/how-to-use-pip-after-the-os-x-el-capitan-upgrade/210021#210021
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31900008/oserror-errno-1-operation-not-permitted-when-installing-scrapy-in-osx-10-11
        
        If you run into this error:
        
        ``OSError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/tmp/pip-nIfswi-uninstall/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/six-1.4.1-py2.7.egg-info'``
        
        You should install a new non-bundled python version:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            brew install python
        
            sudo pip uninstall pynsxv
            sudo pip uninstall six
            sudo pip uninstall PyYAML
            sudo pip uninstall pyraml-parser
            sudo pip uninstall nsxramlclient
        
            pip install pyopenssl
            pip install pynsxv
        
        Installing PyNSXv on Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        **To be Done**
        
        Various caveats
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Should you see this warning message:
        ``UserWarning: /home/vagrant/.python-eggs is writable by group/others and vulnerable to attack when used with get_resource_filename. Consider a more secure location (set with .set_extraction_path or the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable).``
        
        You can solve this by changing the permissions of the .python-eggs
        folder:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            chmod g-wx,o-wx ~/.python-eggs
